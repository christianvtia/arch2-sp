# IEEE-754 Binary-32 floating point translator 

Developed by: Derek Royce Burias, Khryssha Claire Damuy, Christian Tia, and Jan Benjamin Yap (CSARCH2 S12 Group 9)

This project takes an 8-digit hexadecimal or 32-bit binary input and converts it to its corresponding fixed or floating point decimal number. Special cases are included such as 0, -0, infinity, negative infinity, NaN, and denormalized inputs. This translator does not account for error due to conversion.
